    <h1> C programming Language</h1>



    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p><strong>C</strong> is a procedural programming language. It was initially developed by <strong>Dennis Ritchie</strong>  in the year <Strong>1972</Strong>. It was mainly developed as a system programming language to write an operating system. The main features of the C language include low-level memory access, a simple set of keywords, and a clean style, these features make C language suitable for system programmings like an operating system or compiler development.</p>

    <p>Many later languages have borrowed syntax/features directly or indirectly from the C language. Like syntax of Java, PHP, JavaScript, and many other languages are mainly based on the C language. C++ is nearly a superset of C language (Few programs may compile in C, but not in C++).</p>

   <p>C programming is considered as the base for other programming languages, that is why it is known as mother language.</p>

<p>It can be defined by the following ways: </p>
<ul>
   <li>Mother language</li> 
    <li>System programming language</li>
    <li>Procedure-oriented programming language</li>
   <li> Structured programming language</li>
   <li> Mid-level programming language</li>
</ul>

<h3>Conditional Statements</h3>
<p>The if-else statement in C is used to perform the operations based on some specific condition. The operations specified in if block are executed if and only if the given condition is true.</p>
<p>There are the following variants of if statement in C language.</p>

<ul>
     <li>If statement</li>
     <li>If-else statement</li>
     <li>If else-if ladder</li>
     <li>Nested if</li>

 </ul>

<h4>If Statement</h4>
<p>The if statement is used to check some given condition and perform some operations depending upon the correctness of that condition. It is mostly used in the scenario where we need to perform the different operations for the different conditions. </p>
<p>The syntax of the if statement is given below.</p>
<div>
  if(expression){  <br>
  //code to be executed  <br>
  }  
</div>
<h4>If-else Statement</h4>

<p>The if-else statement is used to perform two operations for a single condition. The if-else statement is an extension to the if statement using which, we can perform two different operations, i.e., one is for the correctness of that condition, and the other is for the incorrectness of the condition. Here, we must notice that if and else block cannot be executed simiulteneously. Using if-else statement is always preferable since it always invokes an otherwise case with every if condition.</p>

<p>The syntax of the if-else statement is given below.</p>
<div>if(expression){  <br>
  //code to be executed if condition is true   <br>
  }else{  <br>
  //code to be executed if condition is false  <br>
  }  </div>

 <h3>C Loops</h3>
 <p>The looping can be defined as repeating the same process multiple times until a specific condition satisfies. There are three types of loops used in the C language. In this part of the tutorial, we are going to learn all the aspects of C loops.</p>
 <h3>Types of C Loops</h3>
 <p>There are three types of loops in C language that is given below:</p>
 <ol>
     <li>do while</li>
     <li>while</li>
     <li>for</li>
 </ol>
 <h4>do-while loop in C</h4>
 <p>do-while loop continues until a given condition satisfies. It is also called post tested loop. It is used when it is necessary to execute the loop at least once (mostly menu driven programs).</p>
 
 <p>The syntax of do-while loop in c language is given below:</p>
 <div>
     do{  <br>
    //code to be executed <br>  
    }while(condition);  <br>
   </div>

   <h4>while loop in C</h4>
   <p>The while loop in c is to be used in the scenario where we don't know the number of iterations in advance. The block of statements is executed in the while loop until the condition specified in the while loop is satisfied. It is also called a pre-tested loop.</p>
   <p>The syntax of while loop in c language is given below:</p>
   <div>
    while(condition){  <br> 
        //code to be executed <br>
        }  
   </div>

   <h4>for loop in C</h4>
   <p>The for loop is used in the case where we need to execute some part of the code until the given condition is satisfied. The for loop is also called as a per-tested loop. It is better to use for loop if the number of iteration is known in advance.</p>
   <p>The syntax of for loop in c language is given below:</p>
   <div>
    for(initialization;condition;incr/decr){  <br>
        //code to be executed  <br>
        }  
   </div>
